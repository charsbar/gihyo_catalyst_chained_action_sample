This is a sample application for an article I wrote at gihyo.jp (http://gihyo.jp/dev/serial/01/modern-perl/0007) to explain Catalyst's chained action et al. As the application name (MyApp) suggests, this is not for installation nor ready to use in general. Lots of things are intentionally left untouched as I don't want this sample to be too complicated.

That said, this application is free software. You can redistribute it and/or modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.
